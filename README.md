# Overdone

Demo project for Tentworks Interactive. I ended up cloning some mechanics from Overcooked, it was in my mind when reading the doc. So the player has to plate the food and they can place items on the counters.

# Things Left to Do

## Incomplete
Spent a few days on this. I didn't get around to a few things
- High Scores

- Balance wait times and game time
- In game documentation of controls
## Readability
Some things are not as readable as I would like. 
- It can be hard to read what is on a plate. 
- Tomato and mushroom is more difficult to distinguish than I would like. 
- Stack of plates does not read as a stack.
